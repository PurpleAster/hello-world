About PurpleAster --
Purple asters are are among the early colonizing wild flowers, a wood-aster native to the NE USA where I live, that return to re-wild landscapes that were previously covered with resource intensive turf-grasses. 
My interests are social media data analysis and R coding.
While experienced with social data analysis, I'm a beginner in R which I'm hoping to leverage for scraping and analysis of social data. 
I don't expect to become an expert, but do want to get to basic proficiency to join with worldwide colleagues in collaborative social data projects especially in regards to mis/disinformation and information security in general.
